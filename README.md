This fun page presents the user with a simple yet tricky question: "Do you like/love me?" (customizable). Two buttons appearâ€”"Yes" and "No"â€”but there's a twist!

The "No" button cannot be clicked because it will keep running away. ðŸ˜†
The user must enter a nickname before they can proceed. Without it, they won't be able to click anything.
Once they enter their nickname and click "Yes", you will receive a message via Discord webhook (which you can also customize).
Have fun surprising your Valentine! ðŸ’•

!!! Make sure to enter your Discord webhook! Press Ctrl + F and search for "Discord Webhook here" in LoveMe.html and every file is in same folder !!!

Personalize it however you like! :3
